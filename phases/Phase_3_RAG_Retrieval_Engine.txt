PHASE 3 – RAG RETRIEVAL ENGINE

Goal:
Query → embed → filtered vector search → LLM → cited answer.

Flow:
1. Embed user query.
2. Filter by selected session documents.
3. Perform cosine similarity Top-K search (K=5).
4. Send retrieved chunks to LLM (Groq/Ollama).
5. Return structured JSON:
   {
     answer: "...",
     sources: [{document, chunk_id}]
   }
6. Enable streaming responses.
