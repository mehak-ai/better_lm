PHASE 4 – RANGE-BASED RETRIEVAL

Goal:
Efficient multi-file retrieval using page/chunk ranges.

Implementation:
1. Add page_number and chunk_index to Chunk model.
2. Allow optional range filters:
   - page_number BETWEEN X AND Y
   - chunk_index BETWEEN A AND B

SQL Example:

SELECT *
FROM chunk
WHERE document_id IN (...)
AND page_number BETWEEN X AND Y
ORDER BY embedding <-> query_embedding
LIMIT 5;

Benefits:
- Faster retrieval
- Reduced noise
- Better multi-document comparison
